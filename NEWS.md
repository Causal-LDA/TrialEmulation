# TrialEmulation 0.0.4.2

* Update tests for duckdb 1.2.0 changes to sampling.

# TrialEmulation 0.0.4.0

* Add new extensible S4 class based interface.
  - Step-by-step functions to construct sequence of target trial analysis. See the "New Interface"" vignette.
  - Possibility to add alternative data storage and model fitting functionality. See the "Extending TrialEmulation"
   vignette.
  - Use `duckdb` to store expanded data for efficient reading and sampling of large data.
  - Use `parsnip` models for weight model fitting (experimental, not recommended).
  - This interface is still "experimental" and may change in future
  - Thanks @darkgoldenrod-cherry
